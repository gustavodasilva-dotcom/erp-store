The main reason for this project is an opportunity to exercise and try some new things.

To list some of those new things that I had not tried before, here's some:

- JWT authentication of users at the API;
- Automatic creation of PDFs with Aspose.PDF;
- Utilization of dynamic type (in some situations) instead of one class for each object.

This project was an opportunity to create two applications that communicate with each other through HTTP requests.

(The front-end is not, by any means, beautiful :laughing: but I hope that I could show, with this project, what I really can e know what to do: create interesting back-end applications.)
